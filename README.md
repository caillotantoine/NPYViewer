# NPYViewer 1.23
###  A simple GUI tool that provides multiple ways to load and view the contents of .npy files containing 2D NumPy Arrays.

#### Plot 3-column 2D numpy arrays containing 3D Coordinates as 3D Point Clouds

### Installation:
* Original development in Ubuntu 20.04 and Python 3.8.8
* Also tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 22.04

source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execution:

python3 NPYViewer.py
```

#### Use a virtual environement:
Firstly, navigate to the folder
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python NPYViewer.py
```

### Current Features:
* Open and view .npy files that contain 2D NumPy Arrays and Lists, as spreadsheets
* Convert .npy files to .csv format
* Convert .csv files to .npy format
* Convert .npy files to .mat format (compatible with MATLAB and Octave)
* Plot 2D numpy arrays as Grayscale Images
* Plot 2D numpy arrays containing 3D Coordinates as 3D Point Clouds
* Visualize Heightmaps stored as 2D numpy arrays
* GUI developed using PyQT5


### TODO:
* Add/Remove Rows & Columns
* Copy/Paste Rows & Columns
* Data search and filtering
* Modify content datatypes 
* Handle data with more than 2 dimensions
* Visualize adjacency matrices as graphs


### Changes since last version:
* Convert .npy files to .mat format (compatible with MATLAB and Octave)
